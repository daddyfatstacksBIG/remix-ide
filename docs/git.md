# Working with Git in Remix

## Git in the File Explorer

In Remix, a workspace can be initialized with Git. The Git commands then operate on the workspace.

### Initialize

For information about initializing a workspace, see this [section](#workspaces-initialized-with-git).

### Clone

The clone command is located in the **Workspace hamburger menu**. For more information, see the section about [workspace operations](#workspace-operations)

### Branch Management

When you are in a workspace that is initialized with Git, at the bottom of the File Explorer, youâ€™ll see the place for managing branches.

Then when you click on the branch name, this section will expand with an interface for switching branches and for creating a new branch.

For the rest of the Git commands, go to the DGit plugin.

For more info about the DGit plugin, see [this article](https://medium.com/remix-ide/github-in-remix-ide-356de378f7da).
